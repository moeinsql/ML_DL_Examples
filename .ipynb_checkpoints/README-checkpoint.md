# ML_DL_Examples
## This repository shows the examples of machine and deep learning using python

### Introducing Scikit-Learn and tensorflow using python

### This repository consist of some sample codes demonsterating both machine a deep learning using keras and scikit-learn

#### Each notebook explains and uses some features of ML-DL


- for using datasets and how to manage data in scikit-learn see the [Data Representation in Scikit-Learn](ml_lab_03_01_class_iris_nocode.ipynb)
